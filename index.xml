      <description>Testing Yes, as I already mentioned I love tests. Tests should be treated like the production code they test, right? So They should also be refactored the same way. There should also be time for, and the business side should IMHO understand the importance of it. Sure the business value is not measurable at the moment, but it will be later. Especially when the test code has become a lot of copy-pasting around and engineers don&amp;rsquo;t feel like touching the test code anymore, because it has become kind of complex.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Manuel Vogel. I&amp;rsquo;m striving to grow every day as a person and developer and I like doing good things and talk/write about them. (Kudos for the inspiration go to my buddy r3dsm0k3)
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working at Stocard as a DevOps Engineer, doing awesome stuff with terraform, Docker, TypeScript and bash. In my free time, usually in the dark night hours, I maintain the terraform-provider-docker.
I love automating things because I believe we&amp;rsquo;re all smart people and</description>

      <title>Ilias Client Lib</title>

      <description>The Java ilias client lib extraction Recently I got a request for extending the ilias-client with the ability to add a group to a course. The requestors wanted to use the client tool for this purpose, but a better approach was to slice the corresponding functions out of the existing tool and move it into a client library which could then be used by both tools.
Reason Due to this decision ilias-client-lib was born and released.</description>

      <title>From a Monolith to a microservices architecture</title>

      <description>This project was part of the masters course Distributed Information Systems at the University of Applied Sciences (Karlsruhe) with the task to split a monolithic web shop application running on Tomcat into microservices with the Spring Cloud Netflix stack and exchanging the authentication and authorization to OAuth2.
The final implementation can be found here.
Reason The reason why I put this project on my portfolio is that I decided to go the little extra mile with this project.</description>
