      <description>Testing Yes, as I already mentioned I love tests. Tests should be treated like the production code they test, right? So They should also be refactored the same way. There should also be time for, and the business side should IMHO understand the importance of it. Sure the business value is not measurable at the moment, but it will be later. Especially when the test code has become a lot of copy-pasting around and engineers don&amp;rsquo;t feel like touching the test code anymore, because it has become kind of complex.</description>
