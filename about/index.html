      <h1>About me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Hello, my name is Manuel Vogel. I&rsquo;m striving to grow every day as a person and developer and
I like doing good things and talk/write about them. (Kudos for the inspiration go to my buddy
<a href="https://github.com/r3dsm0k3">r3dsm0k3</a>)</p>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m working at <a href="https://stocardapp.com">Stocard</a> as a DevOps Engineer, doing
awesome stuff with <a href="https://terraform.io">terraform</a>, <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>,
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and bash. In my free time, usually in the dark night hours,  I maintain the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-docker/">terraform-provider-docker</a>.</p>

<p>I love automating things because I believe we&rsquo;re all smart people and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we should not be the robot but build the robot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example by teaching non-engineering heroes how to achieve this well with this little black window, called terminal. So they also share the same joy of automating small tasks of their daily life. The code should strive for simplicity and not complexity. Yes, we spent way more time debugging than actually writing the code. Tests can easily be written before, which is more fun though and should never be omitted. Objects should be immutable, as well as the infrastructure.</p>

<p>Apart from the technical side, I am very proud to have the mental strength after two years to do yoga every day because it helps me to focus on my goals, strengthens my mindset and heals my body.  This lead to the fact that close people around me are saying about me that I motivate them to focus on their goals, by asking the right questions and pushing them a little bit further into the direction they want to go. Constant reflection on my week, month and year help me to ensure that I stay on the right track towards my goals, but on the other hand, enjoy the path to the fullest as well. Books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Homo Sapiens</a> made me re-think a lot of my daily decisions and see the world with different eyes. We disconnect more and more from nature, on the other hand, we need technology to evolve as humankind. We should merely not forget our roots and connect back to mother earth.</p>

<p>This is my private blog and opinions are my own.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop me a line via e-mail (mavogel [ät] posteo [dot] de), whether it might be feedback to show me a different point of view, appraisals if you got inspired, or critique if you found an error. I will be happy to read and answer them.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
