      <description>AWS Redshift This week was much focus on AWS Redshift:
Testing Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to mock a Redshift for testing. As we use white-box testing with Docker containers, I was looking for a container supporting DISTSTYLE, KEYSTYLE, as well as LOAD and UNLOAD. After researching there is no suitable container out there: neither docker-amazon-redshift, nor docker-pgredshift was appropriate. We thought
 adapting the SQL statement so that we could work with a Postgres container or about mocking TCP connections and faking the calls to Redshift  but could not find a solution, because we also did not want to adapt production code for testing.</description>
