      <description>Postgres While creating a projection for a specific use-case, we faced the problem that there was no more room for optimization with indexes on the database. So we had to step back and re-think the whole data model which consisted of 4 tables each having more than 50 million rows. Until this point, we hat cheap inserts and expensive gets on the data model.
After the analysis of the data, we figured out that the approach we took, in the beginning, was a bit too naive.</description>
