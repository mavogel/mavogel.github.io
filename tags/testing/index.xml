      <description>Testing Yes, as I already mentioned I love tests. Tests should be treated like the production code they test, right? So They should also be refactored the same way. There should also be time for, and the business side should IMHO understand the importance of it. Sure the business value is not measurable at the moment, but it will be later. Especially when the test code has become a lot of copy-pasting around and engineers don&amp;rsquo;t feel like touching the test code anymore, because it has become kind of complex.</description>

      <description>Mocking with mock-server When you want to expose another port than 80 from the mock-server you need to change the serverPort. The Docker port mapping does not work in this case, which is strange
This works:
service-mock: image: jamesdbloom/mockserver:5.3.0 ports: - &amp;#34;82&amp;#34; entrypoint: /opt/mockserver/run_mockserver.sh -logLevel TRACE -serverPort 82 networks: test_net: aliases: - service-mock This does not work:
service-mock: image: jamesdbloom/mockserver:5.3.0 ports: - &amp;#34;82:80&amp;#34; entrypoint: /opt/mockserver/run_mockserver.sh -logLevel TRACE -serverPort 80 networks: test_net: aliases: - service-mock Furthermore, when mocking request and it is unclear why a request does not match an expectation merely turn on TRACE logging for the mockserver.</description>
